#REACT WEBPACK BOILERPLATE
This Repository is a Webpack/React Boilerplate for quick start developing.

*REDUX AND REACT-ROUTER ALREADY DROPPED IN*

Webpack has been refactored to work with Babel 6 

Font Awesome is included in a tag in './dist/index.html' cause I like those stupid icons

To get it running:

`npm install`

`webpack --watch --progress --colors`

`node server.js`
